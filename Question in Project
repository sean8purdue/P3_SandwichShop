When initializing all of the driver objects, you should use the constructor that only accepts the driver's name. The driver's name should be “Driver$(I)” where the value of I is the driver object's index in the array. (Driver0, Driver1…)
public Store(String storeName, DeliveryDriver[] drivers)
It can be assumed that the array of DeliveryDriver objects has been initialized properly, has no empty locations, and that all of the DeliveryDriver instances have been initialized properly.
